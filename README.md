## FAQ

#### Why does this project exist?

I was looking into potential solutions for anonymous desktop applications in the dairy sector a short while ago. When very few reasonable solutions were found, I decided to create the Emotion Diary built-in Python.

#### What python version is used?

Please try to use the latest version of Python 3. If any issues arise, then create an issue, and I will get back asap.
